        <p> HALLLOOO SEMUANYAA!!</p>
        <p>sooo, i wanna introduce someone really special to me — Ereen sayangkuu 🫶 </p>
         <img src="img/her4.jpg" alt="she" /> 
      <main>
        <p><h9>idk where to  even start, bcs everything about her just feels... different.
          like, every little thing she does turns into a story worth remembering.</h9>
        <h9> she’s not just pretty — she’s that kind of pretty that hits different.
          the way she listens, the way she makes ppl feel safe and seen. that’s the kind of beauty u don’t just see, u feel.</h9></p>

        <p> she loves dimsum (like bro she could literally eat it everyday 🥟)
            <div class="gallery-card">
              <p><img src="img/dimsum2.jpg" alt="Moment 4" /> </p>
              <p>her fav flower’s tulip, calm and classy — just like her 🌷</p>
              <p> <div class="gallery-card">
     <img src="img/tulip.jpeg" alt="Moment 4" /> </p>
                <h9>and her fav colors — maroon n turquoise</h9>

<p><h9>she’s the type that can make the world feel quiet,
but somehow makes it brighter at the same time.</h9></p>
<div class="gallery-card">
              <p><img src="img/131.jpeg" alt="Moment 4" /> </p>
<p><h9>bhe’s funny w/o even tryna,
sweet w/o pretending,
and real in ways most ppl aren’t anymore.</h9></p>
  
<p><h9>but yeah, not gonna lie.. we had our rough times.
things got distant, and ngl it was all on me.
i messed up. i wasn’t consistent. i was so on-off, and i know that hurt her more than she ever said.
but the thing is...
she still forgave me.
she still came back.
she’s that kind of person, kind enough to love me again, soft enough to give us another shot.</h9></p>

and i swear, i’ll never stop being thankful for that.
if she hadn’t stayed, we wouldn’t be having these lil moments lately, the random talks, the “nothing but everything” kinda convos.

  <main>
  <p><h5>so yeah, i’m lucky.

but i promise i’ll keep tryna be better.</h5></p></main>

<h5><p>you’re the best thing i never thought i’d deserve,
and i just hope u never forget how much i adore u. ❤️
